# .Net Test

In this assignment, I used ASP.NET to build Web API and Sql Server Management Studio for creating my database. 

Before you begin, you will need to create database, adjust connection string in Web.config file and after that, in Package Manager Console, run the command:
```sh
Update-Database
```
This command will also run the Seed() method.
